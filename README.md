# Faulty-Ride-Detection-from-a-given-set-of-ride-data
We have a sample of data which contains starting point and end point latitudes and longitudes for around 300 rides (referred as engagements). The data also contains distance and travel time calculated by meter.we need to find out is that out of this given dataset, which of the engagements are faulty

Here is an example of the data:
{
"engagement_id": 1,
"pickup_latitude": 30. 727539,
"pickup_longitude": 76. 754992,
"drop_latitude": 30. 699249,
"drop_longitude": 76. 784705,
"metered_distance": 5. 7, //(in kms)
"metered_time": 13 //(in mins)
}
